  Abstract                 = {The bed material grain size distribution of gravel bed streams is often spatially heterogeneous. The heterogeneity is actually a random parameter, even for a “well-mixed mixture,” which potentially causes the transport rate for a given bed material to become an uncertain variable. The cause of bed material heterogeneity is the nonuniformity of the bed material, which is analyzed in this paper using examples from field observations and experimental data. The Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to study the uncertainty of the bedload transport rate using Wilcock's experimental data (P. R. Wilcock et al., 2001; P. R. Wilcock and J. C. Crowe, 2003). Each realization of the Monte Carlo simulation employed a randomly generated grain size distribution field for the entire simulation domain. With sufficient realizations the simulation results were adequate to show that the transport rates were a random variable and the mean transport rates did not fall on a single-valued curve when the local heterogeneity was taken into account. The results indicate that the bedload transport rate of nonuniform sediment has an intrinsic uncertainty that can result solely from the bed material. The results also partially account for the scatter of the fractional transport rate within Wilcock's experimental data. This study presents an important concept in understanding the uncertainty associated with estimates of sediment transport.},

SETRAC is the acronym for Sediment Transport in Alpine Catchments. Flow resistance is modelled using an approach proposed by Smart and Ja¨ggi, and bedload transport is predicted with an equation by Rickenmann. Form roughness losses are accounted for by an empirical approach which is based on flow resistance obser- vations in mountain streams. It is possible to compute fractional bedload transport taking grain sorting effects into account. Flow hydrographs are routed through the channel network by using the kinematic wave approach. An application of the model is discussed for an extreme flood event of August 2005 in the Chiene catchment, Switzerland, which mobilized 120,000 m3 of bedload along the mountain stream. The simulation results underline the importance of form resistance when modelling bedload transport in steep and rough channels.},

  Abstract                 = {In August 2005 severe flood events occurred in the Alps. A sediment routing model for steep torrent channel networks called SETRAC has been applied to six well-documented case study streams with substantial sediment transport in Austria and Switzerland. For these streams information on the sediment budget along the main channel is available. Flood hydrographs were reconstructed based on precipitation data and stream gauges in neighbouring catchments. Different scenarios are modelled and discussed regarding sediment availability and the effect of armouring and macro-roughness on sediment transport calculations. The simulation results show the importance of considering increased flow resistance for small relative flow depth when modelling bedload transport during high-intensity flood events in torrents and mountain rivers. Without any correction of increased flow resistance using a reduced energy slope, the predicted bedload volumes are about a factor of 10 higher on average than the observed values. Simulation results were also used for a back-calculation of macro-roughness effects from bedload transport data, and compared with an independent estimate of flow resistance partitioning based on flow resistance data.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative general forms are considered for equations to predict mean velocity over the full range of relative submergence experienced in gravel- and boulder-bed streams. A partial unification is suggested for some previous semiempirical models and physical concepts. Two new equations are proposed: a nondimensional hydraulic geometry equation with different parameters for deep and shallow flows, and a variable-power resistance equation that is asymptotic to roughness-layer formulations for shallow flows and to the Manning-Strickler approximation of the logarithmic friction law for deep flows. Predictions by existing and new equations using D84 as roughness scale are compared to a compilation of measured velocities in natural streams at relative submergences from 0.1 to over 30. The variable-power equation performs as well as the best existing approach, which is a logarithmic law with roughness multiplier. For predicting how a known or assumed discharge is partitioned between depth and velocity, a nondimensional hydraulic geometry approach outperforms equations using relative submergence. Factor-of-two prediction errors occur with all approaches because of sensitivity to operational definitions of depth, velocity, and slope, the inadequacy of using a single grain-size length scale, and the complexity of flow physics in steep shallow streams.},

Since all-inclusive modelling software is difficult to achieve, and possibly even undesirable, integrated modelling requires the linkage of individual models or model components that address specific domains. Emerging from the water sector, the OpenMI has been developed with the purpose of being the glue that can link together model components from various origins. The OpenMI provides a standardized interface to define, describe and transfer data on a time basis between software components that run simultaneously, thus supporting systems where feedback between the modelled processes is necessary in order to achieve physically sound results. The OpenMI allows the linking of models with different spatial and temporal representations: for example, linking river models and groundwater models, where the river model typically uses a one-dimensional grid and a short timestep and the groundwater model uses a two- or three-dimensional grid and a longer timestep. The OpenMI is designed to accommodate the easy migration of existing modelling systems, since their re-implementation may not be economically feasible due to the large investments that have been put into the development and testing of these systems.},

village of Baltschieder was devastated by the Baltschiederbach, which deposited about
200’000 m3 of sediment, of which 120’000 m3 in the gravel range. The event analysis showed
that boulder structures in the stream in normal years prevent high sediment transport, but in rare
situation a threshold value is reached and then enormous sediment inputs can be activated. They
originate from loose material in the valley flanks and in the affluents. A similar event as in 2000
was shown to carry similar loads. A protection concept with two detention basin has been
developed. Immediate measures allowed to build a basin of about 50’000 m3 capacity. In the final
stage this capacity will be tripled. The second basin is needed for very extreme events, but also in
operation cases when the upper basin does not work in an optimal way. Special measures are also
necessary on the stream channel below. In particular, at a bridge capacity is increased by local
lowering of the bed.},

  Abstract                 = {Bedload sediment transport and erosion processes in channels are important components of water induced natural hazards in alpine environments. A raster based distributed hydrological model, TOPKAPI, has been further developed to support continuous simulations of river bed erosion and deposition processes. The hydrological model simulates all relevant components of the water cycle and non-linear reservoir methods are applied for water fluxes in the soil, on the ground surface and in the channel. The sediment transport simulations are performed on a sub-grid level, which allows for a better discretization of the channel geometry, whereas water fluxes are calculated on the grid level in order to be CPU efficient. Several transport equations as well as the effects of an armour layer on the transport threshold discharge are considered. Flow resistance due to macro roughness is also considered. The advantage of this approach is the integrated simulation of the entire basin runoff response combined with hillslope-channel coupled erosion and transport simulation. The comparison with the modelling tool SETRAC demonstrates the reliability of the modelling concept. The devised technique is very fast and of comparable accuracy to the more specialised sediment transport model SETRAC.},

  Abstract                 = {Data from laboratory flumes and natural streams show that the critical Shields stress for initial sediment motion increases with channel slope, which indicates that particles of the same size are more stable on steeper slopes. This observation is contrary to standard models that predict reduced stability with increasing slope due to the added downstream gravitational force. Processes that might explain this discrepancy are explored using a simple force-balance model, including increased drag from channel walls and bed morphology, variable friction angles, grain emergence, flow aeration, and changes to the local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations. Surprisingly, increased drag due to changes in bed morphology does not appear to be the cause of the slope dependency because both the magnitude and trend of the critical Shields stress are similar for flume experiments and natural streams, and significant variations in bed morphology in flumes is unlikely. Instead, grain emergence and changes in local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations seem to be responsible for the slope dependency due to the coincident increase in the ratio of bed-roughness scale to flow depth (i.e., relative roughness). A model for the local velocity within the grain-roughness layer is proposed based on a 1-D eddy viscosity with wake mixing. In addition, the magnitude of near-bed turbulent fluctuations is shown to depend on the depth-averaged flow velocity and the relative roughness. Extension of the model to mixed grain sizes indicates that the coarser fraction becomes increasingly difficult to transport on steeper slopes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces TOPKAPI (TOPographic Kinematic APproximation and Integration), a new physically-based distributed rainfall-runoff model deriving from the integration in space of the kinematic wave model. The TOPKAPI approach transforms the rainfall-runoff and runoff routing processes into three ‘structurally-similar’ non-linear reservoir differential equations describing different hydrological and hydraulic processes. The geometry of the catchment is described by a lattice of cells over which the equations are integrated to lead to a cascade of non-linear reservoirs. The parameter values of the TOPKAPI model are shown to be scale independent and obtainable from digital elevation maps, soil maps and vegetation or land use maps in terms of slope, soil permeability, roughness and topology. It can be shown, under simplifying assumptions, that the non-linear reservoirs aggregate into three reservoir cascades at the basin scale representing the soil, the surface and the drainage network, following the topographic and geomorphologic elements of the catchment, with parameter values which can be estimated directly from the small scale ones. The main advantage of this approach lies in its capability of being applied at increasing spatial scales without losing model and parameter physical interpretation. The model is foreseen to be suitable for land-use and climate change impact assessment; for extreme flood analysis, given the possibility of its extension to ungauged catchments; and last but not least as a promising tool for use with General Circulation Models (GCMs). To demonstrate the quality of the comprehensive distributed/lumped TOPKAPI approach, this paper presents a case study application to the Upper Reno river basin with an area of 1051 km2 based on a DEM grid scale of 200 m. In addition, a real-world case of applying the TOPKAPI model to the Arno river basin, with an area of 8135 km2 and using a DEM grid scale of 1000 m, for the development of the real-time flood forecasting system of the Arno river will be described. The TOPKAPI model results demonstrate good agreement between observed and simulated responses in the two catchments, which encourages further developments of the model.},

It looks at how roughness is traditionally characterized in both experimental and numerical fields, and subsequently challenges the definitions that currently exist. In the end, the authors wonder: Is roughness well understood and defined at all? Such a question raises a number of concerns in both research and practice; for example, how does one modeller use the roughness value from an experimental piece of work, or how does a practitioner identify the roughness value of a particular river channel? The authors indicate that roughness may not be uniquely defined, that there may be distinct “experimental” and “numerical” roughness values, and that in each field nuances exist associated with the context in which these values are used.},

The effects of macroroughness on resistance and flow velocity are not well understood and appropriate field parameters for representing macroroughness in flow velocity equations have not been identified. The prediction of flow velocity in rough and steep streams therefore remains challenging. We measured flow velocity and several macroroughness parameters, i.e., boulder concentration, boulder diameter and protrusion, and roughness of longitudinal channel profiles in six reaches of steep mountain streams with plane bed/riffle, step-pool, and cascade channel morphologies. The between-site variations in flow resistance can be explained to a large degree by nondimensionalization of discharge and flow velocity using channel slope and a characteristic roughness length. Using any of our roughness parameters as the characteristic roughness length, this nondimensionalization leads to a similarity collapse of the entire data set. The remaining differences in flow resistance among the streams are related to dimensionless measures of macroroughness that describe the concentration of boulders or step density in a reach. Boulder concentration represents the measure best describing the data and is used in a simple regression equation for flow velocity. The predictions were better than predictions by the variable power law equation proposed by Ferguson. Although the regression might not be statistically significant, the observed trends suggest that boulder concentration partly explains the residual variance of between-site variation of flow resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {Steep mountain streams typically feature macro-roughness elements like boulders, step-pool sequences, and a varying channel width. Flow resistance because of such roughness elements appears to be an important control on bedload transport rates. Many commonly used bedload transport equations overestimate the transport in steep streams by orders of magnitude. Few approaches take into account the typical macro-roughness elements, and systematic tests of these models with field observations are lacking. In the present study several approaches were considered that allow calculating the contribution of macro-roughness elements to flow resistance. These approaches were combined with bedload transport equations and the predictions were compared to field measurements of discharge, transported bedload volumes, and channel characteristics in 13 Swiss mountain streams. The streams have channel slopes ranging from 2% to 19%, and catchment areas of 0.5 to 170 km2. For six streams there were time series of sediment yields, mostly measured annually, and for the other seven streams sediment volume estimates were available for large flood events in 2000 and 2005. All tested equation combinations achieved an improvement in bedload prediction compared to a reference equation that was uncorrected for macro-roughness. The prediction accuracy mainly depended on the size and density of the macro-roughness and on flow conditions. The best performance overall was achieved by an empirical approach accounting for macro-roughness, on the basis of an independent data set of flow resistance measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {The advance of morphodynamics research into new areas has led to a proliferation of forms of sediment mass balance equation. Without a general equation it is often difficult to know what these problem-specific versions of sediment mass balance leave out. To address this, we derive a general form of the standard Exner equation for sediment mass balance that includes effects of tectonic uplift and subsidence, soil formation and creep, compaction, and chemical precipitation and dissolution. The complete equation, (17), allows for independent evolution of two critical interfaces: that between bedrock and sediment or soil and that between sediment and flow. By eliminating terms from the general equation it is straightforward to derive mass balance equations applicable to a wide range of problems such as short-term bed evolution, basin evolution, bedrock uplift and soil formation, and carbonate precipitation and transport. Dropping terms makes explicit what is not being considered in a given problem and can be done by inspection or by a formal scaling analysis of the terms. Scaling analysis leads directly to dimensionless numbers that measure the relative importance of terms in the equation, for example, the relative influence of spatial versus temporal changes in sediment load on bed evolution. Combining scaling analysis with time averaging shows how the relative importance of terms in the equation can change with timescale; for example, the term representing bed evolution due to temporal change in sediment load tends to zero as timescale increases.},

  Abstract                 = {The Exner equation of sediment continuity is the foundation of river morphodynamics. Generalization of this equation to mixtures of grain sizes has required the introduction of an active layer (i.e., a buffer layer between the sediment moving in the water column and the immobile substrate below). The active layer is defined to be a well-mixed layer, with no vertical structure, that encompasses those grains available to exchange directly with the moving sediment. The sediment in the substrate below exchanges with the active layer only as the bed aggrades or degrades. The active layer concept is a useful one that has served the research community well for 3 decades. However, the division of the erodible bed into a discrete active layer and substrate must represent only an approximation of a more general formulation that contains no active layer and in which parameters pertaining to the entrainment from and deposition to the bed vary continuously with depth below the sediment-water interface. Here the probability density function of bed elevation is used to derive a general Exner equation of sediment continuity with no discrete layers. The formulation is applicable to both sediment mixtures and tracers in uniform sediment. Although the treatment requires more information than that of the active layer approach, it offers the prospect of a better understanding of how streams create a stratigraphic record of their activities through deposition.},

This was done using a data set consisting of 7,636 bed load transport values from the flume (1,317 data) and from 84 river reaches (6,319 field data). It was possible to collapse field and flume data by correcting the ratio between the Shields number and its critical value with a very simple hiding function proposed as a power law of the D84/D50 ratio. In so doing, a surface-based bed load transport formula was proposed. It was successfully tested on an independent data set (comprising sand and gravel bed rivers with slope in the range 0.0002-0.08), with 86% of the values predicted within a precision of 1 order of magnitude. Moreover, the formula reproduced the low transport rates well, contrary to the usual surface-based formulas also tested, and is particularly well suited for estimating low transport rates associated with near-bankfull flow discharge. This new formula is neither time consuming (no fractionwise calculation) nor data consuming (the required parameters are the flow discharge, the active width, the slope, and the surface grain diameters D50 and D84).},

  Abstract                 = {Several decades of flume and field measurements have indicated that in rough turbulent flows the critical Shields stress increases with increasing slope and associated decreasing relative depth. This result contradicts the usual consideration of a decreased critical Shields value on very steep slopes because of increased gravitational effects. However, recent studies have demonstrated that these experimental results could be reproduced with a force balance model if the classical logarithmic velocity profile was replaced with a velocity profile that was more compatible with available velocity measurements over gravel beds. These measurements indicate the existence of a roughness layer that is a zone of almost constant velocity close to the bed, whose properties (mean velocity and turbulence) depended on the flow’s relative depth. Unfortunately, velocity profile measurements for low relative depth associated with steep slopes are scarce, and it is still difficult to include such flow properties in a force balance model. Flow resistance data (on the basis of depth average velocity measurements) are very common and cover a wide range of slopes and relative depths. In this paper these data are used to fit a velocity profile including a roughness layer. When used in a force balance model for incipient motion, it adequately reproduced a data set composed of 270 critical Shields values measured in a flume with near-uniform sediments. The relevance of this research to field problems is discussed using a data set composed of 92 critical Shields stresses obtained from field measurements. Finally, a model is proposed for field applications taking into account the slope effect.},

In simple form the bed load transport is a function of an “effective” discharge times a bed slope factor. The efficiency of the streams in transporting bed load is defined as the deviation from the transport function. It varies over several orders of magnitude, particularly for smaller and steeper streams, whereas flume experiments and larger streams are in better agreement with the simple bed load transport relation. The large variation and the strong decrease in efficiency in smaller streams appears to be associated with substantial form losses for relative flow depths (defined by h/d 90) smaller than ~4–6.},

  Abstract                 = {A data set of 2890 field measurements was used to test the ability of several conventional flow resistance equations to predict mean flow velocity in gravel bed rivers when used with no calibration. The tests were performed using both flow depth and discharge as input since discharge may be a more reliable measure of flow conditions in shallow flows. Generally better predictions are obtained when using flow discharge as input. The results indicate that the Manning-Strickler and the Keulegan equations show considerable disagreement with observed flow velocities for flow depths smaller than 10 times the characteristic grain diameter. Most equations show some systematic deviation for small relative flow depth. The use of new definitions for dimensionless variables in terms of nondimensional hydraulic geometry equations allows the development of a new flow resistance equation. The best overall performance is obtained by the Ferguson approach, which combines two power law flow resistance equations that are different for deep and shallow flows. To use this approach with flow discharge as input, a logarithmic matching equation in terms of the new dimensionless variables is proposed. For the domains of intermediate and large-scale roughness, the field data indicate a considerable increase in flow resistance as compared with the domain of small-scale roughness. The Ferguson approach is used to discuss the importance of flow resistance partitioning for bed load transport calculations at flow conditions with intermediate- and large-scale roughness in natural gravel, cobble, and boulder bed streams.},

  Abstract                 = {CSDMS is the virtual home for a diverse community who foster and promote the modeling of earth surface processes, with emphasis on the movement of fluids, sediment and solutes through landscapes, seascapes and through their sedimentary basins. CSDMS develops, integrates, disseminates & archives software (> 150 models and 3million+ lines of code) that reflects and predicts earth surface processes over a broad range of time and space scales. CSDMS deals with the Earth's surface—the ever-changing, dynamic interface between lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and atmosphere. CSDMS employs state-of-the-art architectures, interface standards and frameworks that make it possible to convert stand-alone models into flexible, "plug-and-play" components that can be assembled into larger applications. The CSDMS model-coupling environment offers language interoperability, structured and unstructured grids, and serves as a migration pathway for surface dynamics modelers towards High-Performance Computing (HPC). The CSDMS Modeling Tool is a key product of the overall project, as it allows earth scientists with relatively modest computer coding experience to use the CSDMS modules for earth surface dynamics research and education. The CMT Tool is platform independent. CMT can easily couple models that have followed the CSDMS protocols for model contribution: 1) Open-source license; 2) Available; 3) Vetted; 4) Open-source language; 5) Refactored for componentization; 6) Metadata & test files; 7) Clean and documented using keywords.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a transport model for mixed sand/gravel sediments. Fractional transport rates are referenced to the size distribution of the bed surface, rather than subsurface, making the model completely explicit and capable of predicting transient conditions. The model is developed using a new data set of 48 coupled observations of flow, transport, and bed surface grain size using five different sediments. The model incorporates a hiding function that resolves discrepancies observed among earlier hiding functions. The model uses the full size distribution of the bed surface, including sand, and incorporates a nonlinear effect of sand content on gravel transport rate not included in previous models. The model shares some common elements with two previous surface-based transport models, but differs in using the full surface size distribution and in that it is directly developed from a relatively comprehensive data set with unambiguous measurement of surface grain size over a range of flow, transport rate, and sediments.},
